# Decorator Pattern

## Intent

Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

## Problem

You need to add behavior to individual objects without affecting other objects of the same class, and subclassing would create too many combinations.

## Solution

Wrap the original object with decorator objects that add new behavior while delegating to the wrapped object.

## Diagram

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Coffee {
        <<interface>>
        +cost(): number
        +description(): string
    }
    
    class SimpleCoffee {
        +cost(): number
        +description(): string
    }
    
    class CoffeeDecorator {
        <<abstract>>
        #coffee: Coffee
        +cost(): number
        +description(): string
    }
    
    class MilkDecorator {
        +cost(): number
        +description(): string
    }
    
    class SugarDecorator {
        +cost(): number
        +description(): string
    }
    
    Coffee <|.. SimpleCoffee
    Coffee <|.. CoffeeDecorator
    CoffeeDecorator <|-- MilkDecorator
    CoffeeDecorator <|-- SugarDecorator
    CoffeeDecorator o-- Coffee : wraps
```

## Our Example

We implement a coffee ordering system with add-ons:

- **`types.ts`**: Defines the `Coffee` interface
- **`coffee.ts`**: Implements `SimpleCoffee` and decorators (`MilkDecorator`, `SugarDecorator`, `WhippedCreamDecorator`)
- **`index.ts`**: Builds decorated coffees with cumulative pricing

## Decorator Chain

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[SimpleCoffee<br/>$2.00] --> B[+ Milk<br/>$0.50]
    B --> C[+ Sugar<br/>$0.25]
    C --> D[+ Whipped Cream<br/>$0.75]
    D --> E[Total: $3.50]
```

## Key Usage

```typescript
let coffee = new SimpleCoffee();           // $2.00
coffee = new MilkDecorator(coffee);        // $2.50
coffee = new SugarDecorator(coffee);       // $2.75
coffee = new WhippedCreamDecorator(coffee); // $3.50
```

## When to Use

- When you need to add responsibilities to objects dynamically
- When extension by subclassing is impractical
- When you need to combine multiple behaviors flexibly

## Run

```bash
bun run src/structural/decorator/index.ts
```
